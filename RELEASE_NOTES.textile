h1. Ripple Release Notes

h2. 0.6.1 Patch Release - 2010-03-17

This is a minor release with fixes for a few issues:

* Riak::Link objects will now be unique when added to RObject#links
  Set. [John Lynch]
* Attributes on Ripple::Document classes are no longer clone, which had
  prevented non-scalar properties from being modified directly (e.g. Array).
* Buckets, keys, and walk specs are properly escaped in URLs
  (including slashes).
* Time-related properties properly convert to string formats in JSON that
  they will work in the context of MapReduce jobs.

h2. 0.6.0 Feature Release - 2010-03-05

This release contains enhancements and bugfixes in preparation for the
Riak 0.9 release.

* The CurbBackend now uses fibers to prevent curl-handle corruption when
  a block is given to streaming operations.
* The default prefix is now "/riak/" to match the latest version of Riak.
* The client configuration for Ripple is now used.
* Added Bucket#new and Bucket#get_or_new for easily creating new objects.
* Added Bucket#allow_mult and Bucket#n_value accessors for more easily setting
  bucket properties.
* Added timestamps! method for easily adding created_at/updated_at to documents.
  [Adam Hunter]
* The 'links' collection on RObject is now a Set instead of an Array.
* All literal messages are now stored in YAML localization files.
* Object siblings (caused by concurrent updates when allow_mult is true) can now
  be accessed directly.
* Map-reduce jobs now have timeouts (in parity with Riak).

h2. 0.5.1 Patch Release - 2010-02-22

This is a minor release with fixes for Ruby 1.9, bundler/edge Rails,
and a minor feature addition. Changes:

* Qualify namespaces for Ruby 1.9.
* Decoupled a few specs that gave the appearance of failure.
* Added "bucket" and "key" properties on Riak::Link objects. [John Lynch]
* Fully-qualify the @JSON@ constant, using @ActiveSupport::JSON@ instead.
* Adjusted gem specification to accommodate edge Rails. [Preston Marshall]

h2. 0.5 Initial Release - 2010-02-10

This is the first release of Ripple, which would not have been possible
without the generous support of Sonian and Basho Technologies.  Many thanks.
It includes:

* A robust basic client, @Riak@, with:
** multiple HTTP backends (curb, net/http)
** sensible client defaults (local, default port)
** bucket access and manipulation, including key-streaming
** object reading, storing, deleting and reloading
** automatic de-serialization of JSON, YAML, and Marshal (when given the right content type)
** streaming POST/PUT bodies (when given an IO)
** method-chained map-reduce job construction
* A document-style modeling library, Ripple, with:
** ActiveModel 3.0 compatibility
** Property/attribute definition with automatic type-casting
** Bucket selection based on class name, with single-bucket inheritance (configurable)
** Validations
** Dirty-tracking
** Simple finders - all documents, by key
** Reloading
